In order to use the methods found in this project, you need to adhere to a specific format of calling said methods.

For generic objects that do not have static returns one must do this:

PvpNetConnection.GetAvailableQueues(new UnclassedObject.Callback((TypedObject result) =>
{
	object member = (object)result["keynamehere];
}));

From this you can access any members of the TypedObject just as you would with a dictionary. I will add as many static returns as I can in order to avoid this as much as possible.


For objects that do have a static class associated with them you must do this:

PvpNetConnection.GetAllSummonerDataByAccount(147682, new AllSummonerData.Callback((AllSummonerData result) =>
{
	string summonerName = result.Summmoner.Name;
}));

By having a static return class we can more easily access the available information.

All of these methods are run Asynchronously.
